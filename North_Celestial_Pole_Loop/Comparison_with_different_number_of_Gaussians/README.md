In this directory, I look at how more Gaussian functions affects the overall model of the cube by analyzing the chi sqaured distributions for both cases. Here, I look at the case of 24 Gaussians vs 32 Gaussians. What I want to see if how the chi squared maps change as the number of Gaussians changes.
