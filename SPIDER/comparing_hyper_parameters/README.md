In this directory, I go over many different ROHSA runs using different sets of hyper parameters. These parameters include Lambda_amp, lambda_mu, lambda_sig and lambda_var_sig. The parameter lambda_var_sig is the main parameter that controls the smoothness of the maps. I wanted to test different combinations of these parameters to find which run would be optimal to use as the final choice. Here, there are mosaics of maps for ease of direct comparison. I looked at the phase maps as well as the standard Deviation spectra as well.
