# SURP_Project - Mukesh Taank

This repository contains all of the work I have completed over the course of the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) at CITA.

Supervisors: Peter G. Martin and Antoine Marchal.

The project and this repository cover the process of analyzing GHIGLS data for the ”Spider” region in the sky. Through working on this project, I have explored extracting archival HI spectral data stored in data cubes and analyzing the cube as well using the ROHSA multi-Gaussian decomposition code. I am using ROHSA's mulit-Gaussian decomposition code to model this data.
