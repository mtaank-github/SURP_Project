# SURP Project 2020-2022 - Mukesh Taank

This repository contains all of the work I have completed over the course of the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA).

Supervisors: Peter G. Martin and Antoine Marchal.

The project and this repository cover the process of analyzing GHIGLS data for the ”SPIDER” field region in the sky. Through working on this project, I have explored extracting archival HI spectral data stored in data cubes and analyzing the cube using the ROHSA multi-Gaussian decomposition code and I am using this code to model this data. The important things we are looking for with this analysis is evidence that a phase transition occurred as the result of an energetic event that pushed gas out of the disk of the Galaxy into the SPIDER.

After two years of hard work at CITA, I am happy to share that this work has officially been acknowledged and published in the Astrophysical Journal. The paper can be seen in the "Publication" folder.
