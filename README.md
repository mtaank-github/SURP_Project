# SURP_Project

This repository contains all of the work I have completed over the course of the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) at CITA.

Supervisors: Peter G. Martin and Antoine Marchal.

This report covers the process of analyzing GHIGLS data for the ”Spider” region, more speciﬁcally, the HI structures located at the disk halo interface that hint at the formation of molecular gas (H2). Through working on this project, I have explored extracting archival HI spectral data stored in data cubes and analyzing the cube as well using the ROHSA multi-Gaussian decomposition code.
